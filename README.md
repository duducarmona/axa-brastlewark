# Brastlewark App

## Description

The project is an app to display the data of Brastlewark's inhabitants.

## Motivation

The motivation is caused by the difficulty of meeting the inhabitants of Brastlewark because they are too busy working or fighting orcs.

## User Stories

**Gnomes – list** - As a user I want to see all the Brastlewark inhabitants so that I can know the details of each one. The user can filter by the gnome name.

**Gnome – detail** - As a user, I want to see the details of the gnome and its characteristics. From this view, the user can go back to the gnomes list by the arrow in the top-left corner.

## How to start the app

- Clone the project from Github (https://github.com/duducarmona/axa-brastlewark).
- Run 'npm run start' in the root directory of the project.
- For a correct display, in Chrome, open 'Inspect' and select the view for iPhone 6/7/8.
